      <p class="pointless-lorem">
        The light in her eyes gladdened the soul—Alyosha felt that. There was
        something else in her which he could not understand, or would not have
        been able to define, and which yet perhaps unconsciously affected him.
        It was that softness, that voluptuousness of her bodily movements, that
        catlike noiselessness. Yet it was a vigorous, ample body. Under the
        shawl could be seen full broad shoulders, a high, still quite girlish
        bosom. Her figure suggested the lines of the Venus of Milo, though
        already in somewhat exaggerated proportions. That could be divined.
        Connoisseurs of Russian beauty could have foretold with certainty that
        this fresh, still youthful beauty would lose its harmony by the age of
        thirty, would “spread”; that the face would become puffy, and that
        wrinkles would very soon appear upon her forehead and round the eyes;
        the complexion would grow coarse and red perhaps—in fact, that it was
        the beauty of the moment, the fleeting beauty which is so often met with
        in Russian women.

        “There are cries, sobs, confusion among the people, and at that moment
        the cardinal himself, the Grand Inquisitor, passes by the cathedral. He
        is an old man, almost ninety, tall and erect, [274] with a withered face
        and sunken eyes, in which there is still a gleam of light. He is not
        dressed in his gorgeous cardinal's robes, as he was the day before, when
        he was burning the enemies of the Roman Church—at this moment he is
        wearing his coarse, old, monk's cassock. At a distance behind him come
        his gloomy assistants and slaves and the ‘holy guard.’ He stops at the
        sight of the crowd and watches it from a distance. He sees everything;
        he sees them set the coffin down at His feet, sees the child rise up,
        and his face darkens. He knits his thick gray brows and his eyes gleam
        with a sinister fire. He holds out his finger and bids the guards take
        Him. And such is his power, so completely are the people cowed into
        submission and trembling obedience to him, that the crowd immediately
        makes way for the guards, and in the midst of deathlike silence they lay
        hands on Him and lead Him away. The crowd instantly bows down to the
        earth, like one man, before the old Inquisitor. He blesses the people in
        silence and passes on. The guards lead their prisoner to the close,
        gloomy vaulted prison in the ancient palace of the Holy Inquisition and
        shut Him in it. The day passes and is followed by the dark, burning,
        ‘breathless’ night of Seville. The air is ‘fragrant with laurel and
        lemon.’ In the pitch darkness the iron door of the prison is suddenly
        opened and the Grand Inquisitor himself comes in with a light in his
        hand. He is alone; the door is closed at once behind him. He stands in
        the doorway and for a minute or two gazes into His face. At last he goes
        up slowly, sets the light on the table and speaks.
