          <p class="biography">
            Fyodor Dostoevsky (1821â€“1881) was a Russian novelist, philosopher, and
            journalist, best known for his deep psychological insight and
            exploration of existential themes. Born in Moscow, he began his
            literary career with Poor Folk (1846), which gained immediate acclaim.
            In 1849, he was arrested for his involvement in a radical intellectual
            group and spent years in Siberian exile. His experiences there
            profoundly shaped his later works. Dostoevsky's major novels include
            Crime and Punishment (1866), The Idiot (1869), Demons (1872), and The
            Brothers Karamazov (1880). His writing delves into morality, free
            will, faith, and the human psyche, influencing thinkers, writers, and
            psychologists worldwide. He is considered one of the greatest
            novelists in world literature.
